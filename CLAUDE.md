# A-LINKS (Adolescents Connect) — Session Memory

Last updated: 10 July 2026 (session 6 — ALL Gap Analysis High +
Medium items done: demographics, M&E exports, School model with FK,
Ambassador Hub. Remaining gaps are Low/Deferred: offline sync,
accessibility pass, WhatsApp.)

## What This Project Is

A-LINKS (Adolescents LINKS) — a national digital platform for
Zambian adolescents (Grades 5–12) covering learning, life
skills/health, digital safety, leadership, clubs, challenges,
and confidential support services. Built for ZCSIF. Harris is
technical coordinator.

**Stack:** PERN — PostgreSQL + Express + React + Node.js
**Frontend:** React + Vite + React Router DOM v6 + Tailwind +
shadcn/ui, plain JS JSX (no TS)
**Backend:** Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL + JWT auth
**Environment:** Windows + WSL Ubuntu

**Project path:** `/mnt/c/Users/HP/Downloads/adolescents-connect-main/`
- Backend: `backend/` → `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend: `frontend/` → Vite dev server `http://localhost:5173`
- API base: `http://localhost:5000/api`

## What's Fully Done

### Frontend
- ✅ All learner pages wired to real APIs (LearnIndex, ClubsIndex, CourseDetail)
- ✅ TeacherDashboard — all 9 sections, full CRUD
- ✅ SchoolDashboard — Promise.all fetching all 4 endpoints
- ✅ Onboarding — syntax bug fixed, user.name → firstName/lastName fixed
- ✅ Profile — avatar uploads to Cloudinary, profile saves to DB, all field bugs fixed

### Backend
- ✅ Full auth (register, login, refresh, logout, forgot/reset password)
- ✅ Courses, quizzes, clubs, challenges, leaderboard, notifications, chat
- ✅ Teacher APIs (lesson plans, materials, activities, quizzes)
- ✅ School APIs (stats, learners, teachers, clubs)
- ✅ Cloudinary upload (avatar + material)

### Security
- ✅ All controllers audited — all writes scoped to req.user.id or req.user.schoolName
- ✅ deleteMany silent no-op fixed — all 3 teacher delete handlers return 404 on non-owned records
- ✅ Quiz authorship — createdById field added (migration applied), createQuiz stamps it,
  listMyQuizzes filters by it
- ✅ School stats field names aligned — backend now returns totalLearners/activeTeachers/totalClubs
  matching what SchoolDashboard.jsx expects
- ✅ Club IDs — seed recreates clubs with real UUIDs, API-created clubs auto-get UUIDs
- ✅ ClubsContext "mine" restoration — verified working end-to-end

### Gap Analysis — High items (session 6, 10 July 2026)
- ✅ User demographics: `dateOfBirth`, `province`, `district`,
  `disabilityStatus` added to User (all nullable). Accepted in
  register + PATCH /users/me, returned by getCurrentUser/updateMe.
  Onboarding step 3 collects them (required for students; province/
  district shown for teachers too). Profile page edits them.
  Province→district dependent dropdowns from
  `frontend/src/lib/zambia-locations.js` (10 provinces, all districts,
  DISABILITY_OPTIONS incl. "Prefer not to say").
- ✅ M&E hub is real: `mande.controller.js` aggregates from DB
  (buildMandeData): totals, registrations by month, participation by
  province (distinct quiz-attempters / learners), quiz performance
  (avg score + pass rate vs passMark), gender/disability/district
  breakdowns, club joins by month. Date range via ?from&to.
  `GET /api/mande/export?format=csv|xlsx|pdf` (exceljs + pdfkit,
  both installed). Mande.jsx fetches real data, 3 export buttons
  download via authenticated fetch → blob.
- ✅ School model (Medium item 1): `School` (id, name unique, province,
  district) with FKs `User.schoolId` and `Club.schoolId` (both
  SetNull). `schoolName`/`Club.school` strings kept as denormalized
  display fields, always synced. Resolve-or-create on save:
  `src/utils/school.js` → `resolveSchool(prisma, name, {province,
  district})` — case-insensitive + trimmed match, canonical name
  written back; used by register + updateMe. school.controller scopes
  by schoolId (falls back to name match if schoolId null).
  createClub stamps both school + schoolId. New endpoint:
  GET /api/schools [auth] (?province= filter) → { schools } — powers
  datalist autocomplete in Onboarding school input. Backfill script:
  `backend/scripts/backfill-schools.js` (re-runnable, run 10 Jul).
- ✅ Ambassador Hub (Medium item 2): models `Ambassador` (1:1 User,
  status PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED/INACTIVE, motivation, bio),
  `LeadershipMission` (title, description, points, isActive),
  `AmbassadorReport` (mission optional — null = general community
  activity, activityDate, participants=reach, evidenceUrl, status
  SUBMITTED/VERIFIED/REJECTED, pointsAwarded).
  `ambassadors.controller.js` + routes at /api/ambassadors.
  Verify awards mission points (25 default for general activities),
  sends notifications on approve/reject/verify via
  createNotification. Leaderboard + GET /users/me/points now sum a
  3rd source: VERIFIED report pointsAwarded. M&E overview/exports
  gained `ambassadorActivity` (active, pending, submitted, verified,
  adolescentsReached) + "Ambassador Activities" report section.
  Frontend: `/ambassador` learner page (state machine: apply →
  pending → approved dashboard w/ missions, report form, evidence
  upload via /upload/material, report history);
  `/admin/ambassadors` admin page (tabs: Applications/Missions/
  Reports); ClubsIndex AmbassadorSection form now POSTs for real
  (was fake local state); AdminDashboard NAV has Ambassadors link;
  Mande.jsx has Ambassador Activities panel.
  Reviewers: ADMIN + PROGRAMME_ADMIN only. Any learner can apply.
- Dev accounts for testing (created session 6, remove before prod):
  - PROGRAMME_ADMIN: phone 0977000001 / AdminPass123!
  - SCHOOL_ADMIN (Woodlands A): phone 0977000002 / AdminPass123!
  - Dev DB also has test ambassador data: john doe is an APPROVED
    ambassador with 1 verified report (75 pts), 1 mission
    "School Assembly Talk" exists.

## Stack / Patterns Reference

### Backend
- No shared `lib/prisma.js` — each controller instantiates PrismaClient directly
- Auth middleware: `src/middleware/auth.middleware.js` → `requireAuth`
- Role middleware: `src/middleware/role.middleware.js` → `requireRole(...roles)`
- `req.user.id` set by `requireAuth`
- Prisma error codes: P2002 = unique, P2003 = FK, P2025 = not found
- Cloudinary: `src/utils/cloudinary.js` → `uploadToCloudinary(buffer, folder)`
  - env var: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` (not CLOUDINARY_NAME)

### Frontend
- `API_URL` from `src/lib/api.js` = `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000/api"`
- Auth token: `import { getAccessToken } from "@/contexts/AuthContext"`
- Auth hook: `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext"` → `const { user } = useAuth()`
- **Real user fields:** firstName, lastName, schoolName, role, grade, gender,
  subjects[], staffId, avatar, onboardingDone, dateOfBirth, province,
  district, disabilityStatus
  - NO name field, NO school field, NO avatarImage field — all fixed
- Toast: `import { toast } from "sonner"`
- Loading/error/empty pattern: animate-pulse skeleton → text-brand-pink error → empty state → data
- **WSL bash:** never use `!` in double-quoted strings — use python3 for all in-place edits

## Known Issues / Deferred

### Item 8 — School scoping fragility — RESOLVED (session 6)
School model with FK added; school.controller now scopes by
schoolId (name-match fallback for unlinked accounts). See Gap
Analysis section above.

### Dead code in createClub
`schedule` is destructured from req.body but Club model has no
schedule field — harmless, just unused.

### Completion % is a proxy
`getSchoolLearners` and `getSchoolStats` calculate completion as
`(quizAttempts.length / 5) * 100` — a rough proxy, not actual
lesson completion tracking. Fine for now.

## End-to-End Test Plan (next session)

Run both servers first:
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd .../backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2
cd .../frontend && npm run dev
```

### Flow 1 — Learner
1. Register new account (phone + password)
2. Complete onboarding (gender, grade, school, interests)
3. Go to Learn → open a course → complete a lesson → complete the quiz
4. Check leaderboard — points should appear
5. Go to Clubs → join a club → hard refresh → still joined
6. Go to Challenges → join a challenge → advance through steps → complete
7. Go to Profile → upload avatar → save profile changes → refresh → changes persist
8. Open Support Chat → send a message

### Flow 2 — Teacher (register separate account, set role to TEACHER in DB)
1. Log in → lands on TeacherDashboard
2. Create a lesson plan → appears in list → delete it → gone
3. Upload a material → appears → delete → gone
4. Create an activity → appears → delete → gone
5. Create a quiz → appears in quiz list
6. Verify quiz is ONLY visible to this teacher (not other teachers)

### Flow 3 — School Admin (register, set role to SCHOOL_ADMIN + schoolName in DB)
1. Log in → lands on SchoolDashboard
2. Stats load (may show 0 if no learners at that school yet)
3. Learners tab → shows only learners with matching schoolName
4. Teachers tab → shows only teachers with matching schoolName
5. Clubs tab → shows only clubs scoped to that school

### Flow 4 — Admin (set role to ADMIN in DB)
1. Log in → Admin dashboard
2. Go to Live Chat → see pending support sessions
3. Reply to learner's message from Flow 1 Step 8
4. Verify learner sees reply (poll or refresh)

### DB verification after full run
```bash
# In backend dir
npx prisma studio   # → http://localhost:5555
```
Check: QuizAttempt, ChallengeAttempt, ClubMember, Notification,
ChatSession/ChatMessage, LessonPlan, TeacherMaterial, ClassroomActivity

## After E2E Testing

### i18n / Bemba
- `LanguageContext.jsx` + `translations.js` already exist
- Plan: migrate to `react-i18next`, populate Bemba string keys
- Scope: UI labels, nav, button text, course UI chrome
  (course content itself stays in English)

### Prisma v7 Upgrade
- Currently on 6.19.3
- Key breaking change: config migrates to `prisma.config.ts`
  (warned in migrations already: "property `package.json#prisma`
  is deprecated")
- Steps: update package.json, run npx prisma generate, test all
  DB ops, create prisma.config.ts

---

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Backend
cd /mnt/c/Users/HP/Downloads/adolescents-connect-main/backend && npm run dev

# Frontend
cd /mnt/c/Users/HP/Downloads/adolescents-connect-main/frontend && npm run dev

# Prisma Studio
cd .../backend && npx prisma studio

# After schema change
npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>

# Re-seed (safe — clubs are deleted+recreated, challenges checked before insert)
npx prisma db seed

# Postgres (WSL)
sudo service postgresql start
```

## Working Style Notes

- Multiple parallel chat threads — always ask for latest memory
  file before assuming context is current.
- python3 for all in-place text edits. Never sed for multi-line.
  Never bash ! in double-quoted strings (WSL history expansion).
- Build things completely. No stubs/TODOs without being asked.
- Production correctness matters: live ZCSIF platform
